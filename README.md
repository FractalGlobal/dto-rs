This library gives the DTO objects to transport data from and to the Fractal Global Credits API. It
contains all the needed objects to perform all operations. Each of them is explained in its own
documentation and can be easily used by third parties.

Using it is as simple as including this in the crate:
```rust
extern crate fractal_dto;
```
